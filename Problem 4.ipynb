    "### Problem Statement \n",
    "\n",
    "Every Friday Raji and her N - 1 friends go for a party. At these parties, they play board games. This Friday, they are playing a game named \"The Dog in the Train\". In this game players have to transport cookies between Delhi and Chennai (only on board). Each player has a personal storage. The players are numbered from 1 to N, Raji is numbered 1. Rules for determining a winner are very difficult, therefore Raji is asking for your help to determine the winner.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 6 types of cookies. For each cookie in the storage player gets 1 point. Also player gets additional points if he packs his cookies in some boxes as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "A box containing 4 different types of cookies fetches 1 additional point.\n",
    "\n",
    "A box containing 5 different types of cookies fetches 2 additional points.\n",
    "\n",
    "A box containing 6 different types of cookies fetches 4 additional points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously a cookie can be put into a single box.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each player, you know the number of cookies in his storage (denoted by c[i]), also the types of cookies in the storage given denoted by type[i][j].\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to determine the winner of this game. Output \"tie\" (without quotes) if there are two or more players with same maximum score, \"raji\" (without quotes) if only Raji has a maximum score, winner's index in all other cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. This will be followed by T test cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the number of players.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second line of each test case contains an integer c[i] denoting the number of cookies in the i-th storage, followed by c[i] space-separated integers type[i][j] which denote the type if j-th cookie in the storage i-th.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output\n",
    "\n",
    "For each test case, output a single line containing the answer as specified in the statement.\n",
